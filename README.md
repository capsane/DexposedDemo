# DexposedDemo
Two demos to show the usage of Dexposed

Demo1:hookAudioStartRecording(). Bypass the hook put in Audio framework using Dexposed. The hook in the System AudioRecord is put by myself.

Demo2:hookSystemLog(). Hook the System.Log.e() method inside the app. 

To test how to use Dexposed, you can try Demo2-hookSystemLog(), since you haven't got the Android system which has the hook.
